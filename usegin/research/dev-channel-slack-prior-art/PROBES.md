# Wire probes — dev-channel Slack design

Live tests against the `Effi Spike` Slack app on the AskEffi workspace.
Run on 2026-04-30. All probes left no residue (test messages auto-deleted).

Scripts live under `probes/`. To rerun, ensure Doppler has
`USEGIN_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (xapp-...) and `USEGIN_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, then:

```
doppler run -- uv run --project experiments/slack-direct \
    python usegin/research/dev-channel-slack-prior-art/probes/<probe>.py
```

## Findings (one-line summary)

| # | Question | Verdict | Design impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| iv | Does Socket Mode load-balance or broadcast across multiple listeners on the same app? | **Load-balanced.** Each event lands on exactly one listener. | Each dev's listener sees only ~1/N of messages; poll-as-correctness layer is mandatory. |
| offline | When NO listener is connected, are events buffered or dropped? | **Dropped.** Reconnect delivers zero gap messages. | Reinforces (iv) — offline windows force a `conversations.history` backfill on startup. |
| i | Does `chat.postMessage(metadata=...)` work with our bot token? Does Socket Mode deliver `event_payload`? | **Yes** to both. Bot token is enough; Socket Mode delivers the full payload inline. | No app-level token needed for posting metadata; receivers route on the inline payload — no extra round-trip. Caveat: `conversations.history` strips `event_payload` unless `include_all_metadata=true`. |
| iii-update | Does `chat.update` preserve username/icon_emoji overrides set on the original post? Does it accept different overrides on update? | **Identity locked at post time.** Update without override: identity persists. Update with a different override: ignored — message stays under the original identity. | No identity drift on edit; but no way to "rewrite history" under a different persona either. |
| iii-delete | Is `chat.delete` blocked on overridden messages? (Handoff suspected yes.) | **No — chat.delete works on overridden messages.** All 4 cases (control, username only, icon only, both) deleted cleanly and were confirmed gone. | Disproves one of the 3 suspected Path A annoyances. Path A is one less annoyance than the handoff thought. |
| bot-self | Does Socket Mode deliver the bot's own messages back to its listeners? | **Yes**, with `bot_id` set to the bot's `B…` id. | Receiver code MUST filter self-echo (matches the 18 cribbable patterns; check `bot_id`, `bot_profile.app_id`, AND `user`). |
| ii (mobile push) | Does mobile push notification show the `username`-overridden identity or the bot's identity? | **Override propagates.** Banners showed `oria` / `claude-on-lihu` / `Effi Spike` (control) — the override is visible at the lock-screen, not just bot identity. | Disproves the suspected Path A blocker. Path A's mobile-notification UX is fully usable. |
| Q1 (MCP) | Does stock Claude Code recognize `notifications/claude/channel` MCP messages from the `claude-code-slack-channel` plugin? | **Not run.** Future-upgrade question, low priority. | TBD. |

## Detail per probe

### Probe iv — load-balance vs broadcast

Two passes:

1. **Interactive, N=3, 2 listeners, real human typing.** 3-of-3 messages went to exactly one listener, never both. Initial signal.
2. **Auto-poster, N=20, 3 listeners, bot posting messages to itself.** 20-of-20 messages went to exactly one listener. Distribution: `L1=6, L2=10, L3=4`. Distribution is uneven (Slack appears to have sticky routing within a connection lifecycle), but the invariant holds: every event lands on exactly one connection.

Slack's docs claim this is intended behavior; we've now confirmed it ourselves. With N developers each running a listener against the shared `Effi Spike` app, each dev sees `1/N` of messages on average via Socket Mode alone.

### Probe offline-queueing

When the only connected Socket Mode listener disconnects, then 3 messages are posted into the channel during the gap, then a fresh listener reconnects: **0-of-3** gap messages were delivered to the reconnected listener after an 8s settle.

Slack does not buffer events while no Socket Mode connection is open. (If a Request URL were configured for the app, Slack would deliver via HTTP webhook instead — but we have only Socket Mode.)

**Implication for design:** every receiver must, on startup AND at a regular cadence (e.g. every 15-30s), call `conversations.history` over the relevant channels to fill in any messages it missed. This is the poll-as-correctness layer that `SYNTHESIS.md` D1 lean B prescribes — now confirmed mandatory, not "nice to have".

### Probe i — metadata field

- **Bot token can post messages with `metadata={event_type, event_payload}`.** No app-level token required for posting.
- **Slack persists the metadata.** Confirmed via `conversations.history(include_all_metadata=true)`.
- **Socket Mode delivers the full payload inline.** The `message` event's `metadata` field includes both `event_type` and `event_payload`. No extra API call needed for receiver routing.
- **Caveat:** `conversations.history` returns only `event_type` by default. To get `event_payload` from the history endpoint (used by the poll-as-correctness layer), you must pass `include_all_metadata=true`. Slack docs say this requires the `metadata.message:read` scope; our bot token works without that scope being explicitly listed, suggesting Slack may have made it part of the default app-author capability.

### Probe iii (update) — identity at post-vs-update

| sub-test | post override | update override | identity after update |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `oria`/`✨` | none | `oria`/`✨` (persists) |
| B | `oria`/`✨` | `oria`/`✨` (same) | `oria`/`✨` |
| C | `oria`/`✨` | `lihu`/`👋` (different) | `oria`/`✨` (update silently ignored the new override) |

Identity is bound at post time. `chat.update` cannot rewrite identity. This is fine for our design (no risk of identity drift after the first append) but means edit history can't reattribute a message under a different persona.

### Probe iii (delete) — does delete work on overridden messages?

| sub-test | post override | chat.delete result | history check |
|---|---|---|---|
| control | none | `ok=True` | gone |
| username only | `oria` | `ok=True` | gone |
| icon_emoji only | `:sparkles:` | `ok=True` | gone |
| username + icon | `claude-on-lihu`/`:robot_face:` | `ok=True` | gone |

The handoff's claim "chat.delete blocked on overridden messages" is wrong. **Delete works.**

### Bot-self events

Probe i's Socket Mode test happened to surface this: when the bot posts a message to a channel its app subscribes to, the resulting `message` event IS delivered back to the bot's own Socket Mode listeners. The event has `bot_id` set to the bot's `B…` id and `user` set to the bot user id.

This means receiver code MUST implement self-echo filtering. The 18 patterns in `READING-claude-code-slack-channel.md` recommend checking three fields: `bot_id`, `bot_profile.app_id`, and `user`. We should lift that pattern verbatim.

## Open

- **Q1 (MCP recognition).** Install `claude-code-slack-channel` plugin, run stock `claude` (without `--dangerously-load-development-channels`), DM the bot, watch for `<channel>` system tag in Claude's context. Determines whether MCP-based injection is a future-available alternative path. Low priority.
- **APP badge visual.** Wasn't probed — visual constraint that Slack documents. Verify by eye on a test message: post one with a username override and look for a small `APP` label next to the name. (Confirmed by Slack docs and many third-party reports; running probes wouldn't add information.)

## Side note — DM-back is currently blocked

When Lihu saw the probe ii DMs on his phone, Slack showed "Sending messages to this app has been turned off" at the bottom of the DM thread. This is a Slack app-config setting on the **App Home** tab → "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab".

Doesn't affect the dev-channel design (replies happen in `#effi-dev` via @-mention or thread reply, not via direct DM to the bot). Flag for later if we ever want a DM-reply path.

## Updated decision impact

`SYNTHESIS.md` D1 lean B (poll-as-correctness layer) is no longer a "consider" — it's **required**. Two independent reasons confirmed:

1. Socket Mode load-balances across listeners → each dev sees ~1/N of messages without polling.
2. Slack drops events for windows with no Socket Mode connection → offline gaps would lose messages without a backfill on reconnect.

`SYNTHESIS.md` D6 (Path A "3 annoyances" list) collapses to **1 annoyance**:

- non-removable `APP` badge — still standing (visual, undocumented to disable)
- ~~mobile push fallback to bot identity~~ — **disproven by probe ii** — push banners show the overridden name
- ~~chat.delete blocked on overridden messages~~ — **disproven by probe iii-delete**

**Verdict on Path A:** the only remaining cost is a small `APP` badge next to the sender name in the desktop UI. Mobile push, edits, and deletes all work cleanly under the per-message identity override. Path A is the recommended path; Hybrid (per-user OAuth) is no longer needed as a fallback.
